				<h1>Hello everyone! <i class="em em-bear"></i> </h1> 
				
				<br>
				
				<p>
				Welcome to Furry's website! 
				Here, you can find everything all about Furry from pictures to her social media. By the way, Furry made this website all by herself! It took me hours to learn how to code all of this, so Furry hopes you enjoy it here!!

				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<br>
				
				<p>
				Well, to start off, Furry (that's me!) is a beary beary cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear">bear</a> that is owned by Felicia Mudjialim. I was made with love at the Build-a-Bear Workshop in Woodland Hills Mall for the value price of $10. I was stuffed on August 28, 2009 as a bearthday present to my current owner, and I have traveled to many places with my owner's family. I may be small, but I have beary big dreams!

					<h5> About the Webmaster </h5>
					<br>
					
					<p>
					Furry has been programming for about 3 years now, and she has delved into programming languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS. Though Furry is not a particularly fast typist (or programmer), she often tries to learn programming hands-on in extended periods of programming to really absorb the language. In her free time, she loves to eat ice cream and play around to make people happy.
